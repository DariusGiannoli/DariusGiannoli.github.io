# Soon-to-be Laidlaw Research Internship at LIS Lab, EPFL

**Let’s be honest:** My acceptance into the Laidlaw Scholars Program is basically a done deal.  
*(Shh, no official word yet—but come on, it’s only a matter of time.)*

## The Project
**Computer Vision & Audio Intent Prediction**  
I’ll be tackling how machines interpret the world by fusing **visual cues** (like gestures, expressions) with **audio signals** (tone, words). Basically, teaching robots to read minds—okay, that’s a stretch, but you get the idea.

## Why LIS?
- **Cutting-Edge Research**: The LIS lab at EPFL is all about intelligent systems, bio-inspired robotics, and advanced machine learning.  
- **Multidisciplinary Vibes**: Nothing beats tinkering with code, hardware, and theories that push the limits of AI.  
- **Future Proof**: If I’m going to be unstoppable, I might as well team up with some unstoppable robots.

## Foreshadowing My Acceptance
> *“Sometimes you just know.”* – Some overconfident (but usually correct) researcher

- **Application’s in**: Check.  
- **Confidence at 110%**: Check.  
- **Ready to shout “Told ya so!”**: Double check.  

Once the official acceptance arrives (any day now, obviously), I’ll be diving into data collection, model building, and unstoppable AI breakthroughs. Stay tuned for the big reveal!
