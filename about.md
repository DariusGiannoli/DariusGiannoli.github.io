# About Me

Hello! I’m Darius Giannoli, born on 16 March 2005 !

Here’s a quick overview of who I am, what I do, and any other interesting facts or background.

I am a first year Computer Science student at EPFL, fascinated in AI, robotics and Neuro-engineering.

I decided to build this website in the night of my 20th birthday (16/03/2025).  
This is a photo taken by my father on the same day on a snowy track near Glacier 3000 in Switzerland :)
